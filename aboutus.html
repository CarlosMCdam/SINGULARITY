                SINGULARITY, firstly known as Galactic Shuttle, was co-funded by two Earthly entrepeneurs in 2524 who wanted to make space exploration into something real.<br><br>
                As years went by and new companies in the field emerged, our young leaders wanted their idea to remain special among them, so they achieved the unimaginable.
                Back in 2532, one single ticket costed around 1.7 million dollars, with the lowest recorded at $960,000, and yet the now renamed SINGULARITY launched the Sagittarius Pass, which offered dozens of destinies at $50,000 each.
                In today´s terms, even millionaire tickets seem reasonable, as 1 million dollars is equivalent to roughly 220 Astros, but back in the day, being a millionaire was a synonym of being rich.
                By achieving this they also ensured the company´s fame and established the brand as the main space travelling option, keeping itself as the best one in the market until our days.

                We still share their view. Everybody should be given the option to get to know their home galaxy, and with each year that passes, we bring closer this dream to our reality.
                As of now, our shuttles reach about 0.7% of all solar systems in The Milky Way, which small as it may seem, translates into hundreds of thousands of destinations,
                and while some of these trips may cost a fortune, many more satisfy our affordable standard. Future looks bright!
